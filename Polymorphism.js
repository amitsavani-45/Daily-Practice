/*Polymorphism

Definition: Polymorphism means “many forms”—the ability of an object to take multiple forms.

Key points:

Can be achieved through method overloading (same method name, different parameters) and method overriding (child class changes parent’s method behavior).

Makes code more flexible and extensible.
