/*JavaScript Debugging
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in your code. Think of it like being a detective 🕵️ - you look for clues to solve the mystery!

Why Debug?
Even the best programmers make mistakes:

Typos in variable names
Logic errors (code runs but gives wrong results)
Unexpected user input
Browser compatibility issues
